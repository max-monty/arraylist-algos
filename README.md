# ArrayList Algorithms - Student Guide

## Today's Learning Goals
- Master common ArrayList algorithms (finding min/max, averages, filtering)
- Learn to work with multiple ArrayLists at once
- Apply these skills to real-world programming scenarios

## Class Schedule (60 minutes)

### 1. Quick Review (5 min)
Key ArrayList Concepts:
- Creating new ArrayLists
- Core operations: add(), remove(), get(), set()
- How to iterate through ArrayLists
- Important: Avoid modifying lists while iterating!
- Watch out for index bounds

### 2. Activity 1: ArrayList Basics (20 min)
Grade Tracking System
- We'll start by finding highest grades (teacher demo)
- Then work in pairs to implement:
  - Finding average grades
  - Filtering passing/failing grades
  - Handling edge cases (empty lists)
- Share our solutions with class

### 3. Activity 2: Parallel ArrayLists (20 min)
Library Management System
- Learn how to work with two related ArrayLists
- Important concepts:
  - Keeping lists synchronized
  - Making sure indexes match
  - Updating both lists together
- Pair programming exercise
  - Switch roles halfway through!
  - Think about edge cases
  - Consider alternative approaches

### 4. Challenge Activity (10 min)
Playlist Manager
- Work on playlist operations:
  - Reversing playlists
  - Rotating songs
  - Removing duplicates
- Tips:
  - Start simple
  - Plan before coding
  - Test with small examples

### 5. Wrap-up (5 min)
- Share our solutions
- Discuss different approaches
- Connect to real-world applications

## Tips for Success
- Ask questions early if stuck
- Test your code with different cases
- Think about efficiency
- Document your approach
- Work with your partner when assigned

## What to Watch Out For
- Off-by-one errors in loops
- Modifying lists while iterating
- Forgetting edge cases
- Index matching in parallel lists

## Need Extra Challenge?
If you finish early:
- Try optimizing your solution
- Create additional test cases
- Add extra features
- Help others who might be stuck
